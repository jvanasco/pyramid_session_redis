    `GracefulCookieSerializer` is designed to help developers migrate sessions
    across Pyramid/pyramid_session_redis versions by catching deserialization
    failures due to a change in how cookies are signed/checked.

    This class will:
      * attempt to deserialize with new format, and fallback to the legacy
        if that fails
      * serialize into the new format

    By providing a `logging_hook` (see tests for example usage), a developer
    can profile their app to understand how the migration of users is
    progressing.

    Using this or any pickle-based serializer is not recommended, as it can
    lead to a code exploit during deserialization. This is only provided as
    a temporary migration tool.
