      This is not yet supported in WebOb, but will be as it was recently added
      to the cookie spec.
    * fixed markup in CHANGES.md (PR #27; thank you @Deimos)

* 2019.09.20
    * version 1.5.1
    * !!!!! SECURITY FIX. **NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE BY DEFAULT**
    * support for `same_site` cookies
    * inline docs improved
    * configs_bool moved to `utils`, still accessable for now.
    * black formatting
    * security fix: changed `session_id` signed serialization.
      this was provided by the deprecated functions `pyramid.session.signed_serialize`
      and `pyramid.session.signed_deserialize`, which are removed in Pyramid 1.10.0+ and
      are considered to be a security vulnerability. using these functions allows
      a malevolent actor to submit a malicious payload that could cause a security
      issue.  This functionality is now handled by constructing a
      `webob.cookies.SignedSerializer()` (which uses JSON (de)serializtion) based on the
      provided `secret`, and using a `_NullSerializer` to encode the session_id
      (only a string session_id is stored in the cookie, so we just need to let the inpu
      string pass through). If desired, a devloper can provide a `cookie_signer`
      object instance to customize this functionality.
    * new `pyramid_session_redis.legacy` - tools to deal with upcoming Pyramid API
      changes (see issue #19)
    * new `pyramid_session_redis.legacy.LegacyCookieSerializer` - implementation
      of Pyramid `1.x > 1.10` signed cookie via the deprecated `signed_serialize`
      and `signed_deserialize` functions. these functions have been copied from
      pyramid and made available through an interface that is compatable with
      the Pyramid 1.10/2.x decision to use `webob.cookies.SignedSerializer`. this
      is only provided for migration and should not be used as it risks security
      issues.
    * new `pyramid_session_redis.legacy.GracefulCookieSerializer` - a serialzer
      that can temporarily replace the new usage of `SignedSerializer` by allowing
      a fallback to the legacy signed_serialize/signed_deserialize functions.
      This serializer allows for logging of serialization attempts and tracking
      the progress of migrating your userbase.  this
      is only provided for migration and should not be used as it risks security
      issues.

* 2019.06.27
    * version 1.5.0
    * new requirements to prepare for Pyramid 2.0 deprecations
    * version 1.4.3, originally scheduled for * 2019/04/27
    * using six to handle python3 instead of some homegrown things

* 2017.10.17
    * version 1.4.2
    * set default timeout trigger to `None` (issue #12, forked from #11)
    * migrated `pyramid_session_redis._finished_callback` into `RedisSession._deferred_callback`
    * introduced new `set_redis_ttl_readheavy` option for read-intensive deployments

* 2017.10.17
    * version 1.4.1
    * fixed a deployment error on 1.4.0 that had a non-ascii character in the readme
    * forgot to run Python3 tests

* 2017.10.17
    * version 1.4.0
    * updated deprecation warnings
    * prepping for ability to not create sessions on every access.  getting spidered by bots who don't use sessions hurts Redis.
    * renamed `util.get_unique_session_id` to `util.create_unique_session_id`
    * added `util.empty_session_payload`
    * migrated some RedisSessionFactory functions into a more global (not per-request) block
    * added `func_invalid_logger` to session factory, also renamed internal exceptions. they were not a public api so there is no deprecation issue.
    * this seems fine in our production usage, so pushing live.

* Unreleased
    * skipped 1.3 release.  not enough usage to warrant backwards compat right now
    * a bunch of api changes to support lazy-created sessions.  the original structure would immediately create sessions, which can cause issues with bots and spidering.

* 2017.01.24
    * version 1.2.2
    * merged most of pull request https://github.com/jvanasco/pyramid_session_redis/pull/3 from Chad Birch (@Deimos)
    * clarified assume_redis_lru in docs, added tests
    * added `force_redis_ttl` kwarg to `RedisSession.do_refresh`
    * added `set_redis_ttl` deprecating it's inverse: `assume_redis_lru`.  the `assume_redis_lru` kwarg will be supported until the 1.4.0 release.
    * added `use_int_time` as session factory arg. this will cast the `created` time to int(math.ceil(time)), saving some space

* 2017.01.17
    * version 1.2.1
    * fixed bug with session.invalidate that caused placeholder sessions to be created( https://github.com/jvanasco/pyramid_session_redis/issues/2 )
    * added test to guard against above bug
    * fixed some whitespace issues (trailing spaces, tabs-not-spaces)
    * migrated pacakge version id from setup.py into __init__.py as "__VERSION__" variable.
    * migrated tests and code to handle webob 1.7's deprecation of cookie values

* 2016.12.23
    * version 1.2.0
    * merged PR1 from hongyuan1306 (https://github.com/jvanasco/pyramid_session_redis/pull/1)
        * Make the package Python3 compatible
        * Consolidate token/session generation
        * Leverage token/session generation from python3.6 stdlib; fallback otherwise.
    * updated the bits on token_urlsafe from 32 to 48; this encodes to a 64 character string

* 2016.11.10
    * version 1.1.2
    release error fix.

* 2016.11.10
    * version 1.1.1
    * integrated/rewrote pr from pyramid_redis_sessions for session leakage on cdns
        https://github.com/ericrasmussen/pyramid_redis_sessions/pull/74/files
    * response.vary will now ensure `Cookie`
    * Session factory now accepts `func_check_response_allow_cookies(response)` a callable which can disable setting the cookie.
    * streamlined some work in utils

* 2016.11.09
	renamed to pyramid_session_redis

* 2016.08.15
	* Changes for jvanasco branch
	    * added `deserialized_fails_new` to handle deserialization errors

* 2016.08.12
	* Changes for jvanasco branch
    	* made the detection of nested changes configurable. by default this is set to True.

* 2016.06.16
	* Changes for jvanasco branch
		* changed `persist` from being "on demand" into a single callback via pyramid's `add_finished_callback`
		* changed `refresh` from being "on demand" into a single callback via pyramid's `add_finished_callback`
		* decoupled active `session` from being a particular named attribute on the "request".
		* removed an initial call to redis' `EXISTS`. Instead of "If EXISTS then GET", we simply GET the active session and create a new one if it does not exist.
		* replaced separate calls to "SET" and "EXPIRE" with single "SETEX"
		* added a feature to assume redis is operating as a LRU cache, therefore not sending expiry data
		* ensure nested session values trigger a persist by calculating an md5 hash of the serialized session data on load; then again in the finished callback
